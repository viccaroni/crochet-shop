# CROCHET SHOP
A lovely store where you can get all kinds of crochet made items and products.
"froggy's workshop" relates back to crochet as "frogging" is a term in crochet where it means to undo rows.
I pushed for a pastel, colourful theme for my website which i personally think made it seem a lot more inviting and fun.

* I made the logo off of Canva by using premade things and adjusting it to my liking

* I used the free to use photo site called Pexels to find different kids of crochet pieces to display on my page as products 
* I also had to make my own "add to cart" button as the bootstrap i found for those cards did not have buttons

* The coolest thing about this login page is that theres a little animation as the background

# Sign-up

* My sign up page also has the same animations, about this sign up page i had to almost do all of this myself, there wasnt a sign up page that looked similar to the login page so i got code for a sign up page and with a lot of trial and error i got it to all fit 
* Theres also a radio button for customers signing up to answer where they found my website

# Checkout

* The checkout page was probably the second complicated thing for me and it was because i was moving really quickly to complete everything and then had a mental crash and did not was to do it. 
* Since this is just an assignment to understand bootstrap i assumed it would be okay to be a little silly on at least one thing so i added funny places for my countries and states

# Most interesting code i wrote
* It was interesting as i spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to make it stick to the top of the screen which i realised it was really simple and just also trying to find a nav bar that i think suited my website
```
<header class="sticky-top">
      <nav class="navbar navbar-light navbar-expand-lg">
        <div
          class="collapse navbar-collapse d-flex justify-content-center"
          id="collapsibleNavbar"
        >
          <ul class="navbar-nav">
            <li class="nav-item active">
              <a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Home</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="shop.html">Shop</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="login.html">Login</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="signup.html">Sign-Up</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="checkout.html">Checkout</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>
 ```
